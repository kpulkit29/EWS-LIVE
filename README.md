# EWS-Ethereum web services

EWS is a dApp built on the top ethereum blockhain and ipfs
   
   . It allows the user to upload files on IPFS.
   
   . Through the EWS smart contract the files are mapped to user public address.
   
   . On the view section the mapped files are visble which are in turn pulled out through IPFS gateway
